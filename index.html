<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Trolls have been harassing the town of Copperplate for too long. You and your friends have decided to do something about it. Grabbing up your palette of colours, your rusty photoshop, and your +1 blade of data visualization, you team up with a Hipster Scripter, a Geek Tagger, and a Goth Stylist to rid the community of this troll menace once and for all. Little do you know what dark Open Sourcery lies behind this seemingly straightforward flame war.</p>
<p>Welcome to the world of Onlinia.</p>
<p>The Web shapes the world and makes the world, and many strange things exist in The Web: ferocious Viral Memes, #C72 Jellies, Spam Bots, and exotic beasts. You are one of the creators and maintainers of The Web, helping to tame the frontiers, to shape the experiences, to bring Usability to the masses, and (hopefully) bring a bitcoin to your pocket doing so, or even win big with the great payday: The IPO.</p>
<p>As a maintainer of The Web you take on the role of one of the classes who care for the web: the holy Designer who works with colour, image, and layouts of great power, the Stylist who nimbly separates the form from the function (and pockets the form), the Scripter who wields scripts that can change the very content of The Web, or the sturdy Tagger strongest and bravest of all, who can battle even the fiercest of Infinite Loops with his mighty HTML5 tags. There are also sub-classes which straddle these realms of influence.</p>
<h2 id="character-creation">Character Creation</h2>
<h3 id="attributes">Attributes</h3>
<h4 id="standards">Standards</h4>
<p><img src="http://www.w3.org/QA/2008/06/web-standards-do" alt=""></p>
