## Introduction

Trolls have been harassing the town of Copperplate for too long. You and your friends have decided to do something about it. Grabbing up your palette of colours, your rusty photoshop, and your +1 blade of data visualization, you team up with a Hipster Scripter, a Geek Tagger, and a Goth Stylist to rid the community of this troll menace once and for all. Little do you know what dark Open Sourcery lies behind this seemingly straightforward flame war.

Welcome to the world of Onlinia.

The Web shapes the world and makes the world, and many strange things exist in The Web: ferocious Viral Memes, #C72 Jellies, Spam Bots, and exotic beasts. You are one of the creators and maintainers of The Web, helping to tame the frontiers, to shape the experiences, to bring Usability to the masses, and (hopefully) bring a bitcoin to your pocket doing so, or even win big with the great payday: The IPO.

As a maintainer of The Web you take on the role of one of the classes who care for the web: the holy Designer who works with colour, image, and layouts of great power, the Stylist who nimbly separates the form from the function (and pockets the form), the Scripter who wields scripts that can change the very content of The Web, or the sturdy Tagger strongest and bravest of all, who can battle even the fiercest of Infinite Loops with his mighty HTML5 tags. There are also sub-classes which straddle these realms of influence.

## Character Creation

### Attributes

#### Standards

![](http://www.w3.org/QA/2008/06/web-standards-do)


Ability to know, use, abide by, and leverage the standards (both *de jure* and *de facto*) of The Web.

#### Persistence

![](http://venturebeat.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/office-space-desk.jpg)

Strength of character and resolve enough to persevere in the face of deadlines, crises, and IE6.

#### Agility

![](http://crisismapper.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/system_testing_cartoon.png)

How fast you can come up with solutions to problems, iterate on new releases, and turn the company around a failing business model towards sustainability, without screwing up completely?

#### Search

![](searching_bear.png)

Measures your ability to find the information you're looking for quickly. Not just raw Google searches, but a rich archive of stored links, code snippets, examples, tutorials, and generators.

#### Elegance

How readable is your code? How well do the colours in your design work together? How concisely can you write a specification? This is a measure of your good taste and ability to be guided by experience and a deep knowledge of What Is Right and Good.

#### Whuffie (or should this be experience?)

This is your Google Juice, your Slashdot karma, your Advogato reputation, how well known and trusted you are in the community, and therefore how much you are able to lead and to be believed. A high whuffie can be more important and useful than having a large bank account. Use fame to raise a flashmob army.

#### Other options:

Health as battery life (vampires drain your battery?). Hit locations: CPU, hard drive, RAM, monitor, keyboard? Recharge to get health back.

### Saving Throws

From time to time your character will need to roll to avoid some fate.

#### vs. Firing

Rolled for both contract and employee workers when a deadline is missed or mass layoffs occur. Contractors roll at -2.

#### vs. LOL

#### vs. Distraction

#### vs. Seeing what cannot be unseen

#### Geek

Like dwarves, focussed on a task and a theme to the exclusion of all else. There are many different kinds of Geeks: Music Geeks, Programming Geeks, Gaming Geeks.

Well-rounded humans, who might want to go home to their families at 5pm, or even have friends outside of work.
